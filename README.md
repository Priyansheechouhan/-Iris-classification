# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the **Iris Classification** project!  
This project demonstrates how to use classic machine learning techniques to classify iris flowers into three species based on sepal and petal dimensions.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains **150 samples** of iris flowers with the following features:

- `SepalLengthCm`
- `SepalWidthCm`
- `PetalLengthCm`
- `PetalWidthCm`
- `Species` (Target: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

✅ Performed **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** using visualizations  
✅ Applied **Label Encoding** for target variable  
✅ Built and evaluated multiple classification models:  
- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest

✅ Achieved **up to 100% accuracy** with KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest  
✅ Compared model performances and visualized results

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Checked data distribution and class balance
- Used **pair plots**, **boxplots**, and **heatmaps** for feature correlation
- Discovered that **petal length and width** are the most impactful features

## 🧠 Models Used

| Algorithm            | Accuracy |
|----------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression  | 96.7%    |
| K-Nearest Neighbors  | 100%     |
| Decision Tree        | 100%     |
| Random Forest        | 100%     |

All models performed exceptionally well due to clean and linearly separable data.
